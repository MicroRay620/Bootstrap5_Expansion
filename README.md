# Bootstrap 5 Expansion
A repository that has expansions for your projects that involve Bootstrap 5.

# Purpose of this repository
This repository is a project for some functions that I, Ruby Rose, feel should natively be in Bootstrap 5 but aren't.
To add this repository to your project:
1. Download the files
2. Extract the folder or files into your project
